Learning Objectives

By the end of completing this project, you should be capable of explaining the following concepts without resorting to external resources:

General

Understanding the concept of pointers to pointers and how to utilize them
Grasping the concept of multidimensional arrays and their practical applications
Becoming familiar with the commonly used C standard library functions for manipulating strings
Requirements

General

You're allowed to use editors like vi, vim, or emacs.
Your code will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
Compilation of your programs and functions will be done using gcc 4.8.4 with the flags -Wall, -Werror, -Wextra, and -pedantic.
Every file you submit must end with a new line.
It's mandatory to have a README.md file at the root of your project folder.
Your code should adhere to the Betty style, which will be verified using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
Global variables are strictly prohibited.
Each file should contain no more than 5 functions.
You cannot utilize standard library functions like printf, puts, etc. Any such usage is forbidden.
However, you're allowed to use the _putchar function.
Note that there's no need to submit _putchar.c, as we will utilize our own version. If you do submit it, we won't consider it.
While the provided main.c files can be used for testing your functions, there's no requirement to submit them. Our compilation will employ our own main.c files, which might differ from the examples.
Ensure that your header file, named holberton.h, contains function prototypes for all your functions, including the prototype for the _putchar function.
Don't forget to push your header file.
Additional Information

For this project, you're not expected to learn about pointers to functions, arrays of structures, malloc, and freeâ€”these topics will be covered in the future.

3. strspn	Write a function that calculates the length of a prefix substring.
4. strpbrk	Construct a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.
5. strstr	Implement a function that finds a substring within a string.
6. Chess is mental torture	Create a function that prints a chessboard.
7. The line of life is a ragged	Design a function that calculates the sum of two diagonals in a square matrix of integers.
8. Double pointer, double fun	Develop a function that sets the value of a pointer to a char.
